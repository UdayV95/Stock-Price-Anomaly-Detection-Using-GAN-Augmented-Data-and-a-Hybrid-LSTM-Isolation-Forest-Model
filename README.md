# Stock-Price-Anomaly-Detection-Using-GAN-Augmented-Data-and-a-Hybrid-LSTM-Isolation-Forest-Model
 This project detects stock price anomalies using a hybrid LSTM-Isolation Forest model. To address data imbalance, GANs generates realistic synthetic anomalies for better training. The model effectively identifies anomalies, achieving strong classification performance.
